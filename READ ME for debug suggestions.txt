A Note from the Author:
The game will save on exit if you exit through the red X on the corner of the window.
The game should also properly auto-load on start if no data was altered outside the game.

Known Bugs:
The last item in the inventory list has a chance to duplicate once you reload the game.
I tried to fix this but wasn't able to make it stop.

Debug Help:
Should you wish to dubug features (such as the birthday), the pet's data is in this format:

[WARNING]: Should you alter data, take care not to hit [ENTER] because creating a new line will prevent
successful data loading in any of the files. Instead, if you change a value, just hit [CTRL+S] right away.
If you find that some data isn't loading properly, there's a chance an extra enter is the culprit.
In this case, you'd need to delete the file that isn't loading so that a new one may be created on Exit

FAQ:

Q: Why aren't there progress bars in other pages besides the Main Menu?
A: Originally, I wanted to do this but after having trouble with the progress bar updating in the
	Walk Page in Real-Time, I resorted to Labels which also have a "Refresh" feature.
	It's also for this reason that the Walk Page is my least favorite/successful page... :/

Q: What if I run out of Gems and my Pet needs more food?
A: I consider that a "Game Over". You'd have to delete all Pet Data to restart.
	I have added a CLEAR ALL button in the game to facilitate this.
	[WARNING] this process is irreversible, 

Q: How can I get more Gems?
A: Making In-Game Purchases! (Just kidding) Well one way is by celebrating the Pet's birthday.
	Another way is to perform Pet Skills. There's a small chance that you earn 5 Gems on a success.

Q: Why does the Dog have the best stats? Shouldn't the game be more balanced?
A: Because I totally have a preference for dogs. An unbalanced game can be more interresting.
